## Multiple Regression

**ANOVA models have**:

 * a quantitative response variable (sepal width of a flower) and
 * one categorical explanatory variable (species)
 * Separate mean sepal width for each species, individual values normally distributed around the mean

**Simple linear regression models have**:

 * a quantitative response variable (college graduation rate) and 
 * one quantitative explanatory variable (college acceptance rate)
 * Mean graduation rate is a linear function of acceptance rate, individual values normally distributed around the mean

**Multiple regression models have**:

 * a quantitative response variable and
 * more than one explanatory variable, may be a mix of categorical and quantitative
 * Examples:
    * $\mu(Y|X_1, X_2) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2$
    * $\mu(Y|X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 + \beta_4 X_4$
    * $\mu(Y|X_1, X_2) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(X_1) + \beta_2 \log(X_2)$
    * $\mu(Y|X_1, X_2) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_1 \times X_2 + \beta_4 X_1^2$

We will start by combining one categorical explanatory variable and one quantitative explanatory variable.

## Example of Two Parallel Lines

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# set seed and sample_frac to get both species in the first few rows.
set.seed(123)

crocs <- read_csv("http://www.evanlray.com/data/sdm4/Crocodile_lengths.csv") %>%
  mutate(Species = factor(Species)) %>%
  sample_frac(size = 1) %>%
  as.data.frame()
```

We have measurements of the head length (cm) and total body length (cm) of 32 crocodiles of two different species:

```{r}
head(crocs)
nrow(crocs)
```

```{r, fig.height=2}
ggplot(data = crocs) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Body, y = Head, color = Species)) +
  theme_bw()
```

\newpage

### 2 lines by filtering to create separate data sets

```{r}
aus_crocs <- crocs %>% filter(Species == "Australian")
aus_fit <- lm(Head ~ Body, data = aus_crocs)
summary(aus_fit)
```

```{r}
ind_crocs <- crocs %>% filter(Species == "Indian")
ind_fit <- lm(Head ~ Body, data = ind_crocs)
summary(ind_fit)
```

#### Questions we'd like to be able to answer (but can't with this output):

1. How strong is the evidence that the intercepts for these lines are different? (today)
1. How strong is the evidence that the slopes for these lines are different? (next class)

\newpage

### 2 parallel lines (same slope)

* Our Goal: Equations for two lines
\begin{align*}
\text{Estimated Mean Head Length for Australian Crocs } &= \hat{\beta}_0^{Australian} + \hat{\beta}_{1} \times (\text{Body Length}) \\
\text{Estimated Mean Head Length for Indian Crocs } &= \hat{\beta}_0^{Indian} + \hat{\beta}_{1} \times (\text{Body Length})
\end{align*}

 * Note: Different intercepts, same slope.

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.height=2}
parallel_lines_fit <- lm(Head ~ Body + Species, data = crocs)
summary(parallel_lines_fit)

crocs <- crocs %>%
  mutate(
    fitted = predict(parallel_lines_fit)
  )

ggplot(data = crocs) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Body, y = Head, color = Species)) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = Body, y = fitted, color = Species))
```

* R gives us a single combined equation:
$$\text{Estimated Mean Head Length} = \hat{\mu}(\text{Head} | \text{Body}, \text{Species}) = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_{1} (\text{Body}) + \hat{\beta}_2 \text{SpeciesIndian}$$

$$\hat{\mu}(\text{Head} | \text{Body}, \text{Species}) = 2.27 + 0.13 (\text{Body}) + 8.89 \text{SpeciesIndian}$$

\newpage

#### What is the `SpeciesIndian` variable?

* Behind the scenes, R creates a new **indicator variable** called `SpeciesIndian`:
$$\text{{\tt SpeciesIndian}} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{ if the species for crocodile $i$ is Indian.} \\
0 & \text{ otherwise (in this case, the species is Australian)} \end{cases}
$$

* R doesn't modify the data frame (it creates a secret copy in the background), but it would look like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
crocs <- mutate(crocs,
  SpeciesIndian = as.integer(Species == "Indian"))
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
head(crocs)
```

Above, we obtained this estimated equation:

$$\hat{\mu}(\text{Head} | \text{Body}, \text{Species}) = 2.27 + 0.13 (\text{Body}) + 8.89 \text{SpeciesIndian}$$

#### What is the estimated equation describing the relationship between body length and head length, for Australian crocodiles?

\vspace{2cm}

#### What is the estimated equation describing the relationship between body length and head length, for Indian crocodiles?

\vspace{2cm}

#### What is the interpretation of $\widehat{\beta}_0 = 2.27$?

\vspace{2cm}

#### What is the interpretation of $\widehat{\beta}_1 = 0.13$?

\vspace{2cm}

#### What is the interpretation of $\widehat{\beta}_2 = 8.89$?

\newpage

#### Using the output from the summary function, conduct a test of the claim that a single regression line can be used to describe the relationship between body length and head length in the population of all Australian and Indian crocodiles.

\vspace{3cm}

#### Conduct a test of the claim that neither species nor body length are associated with head length in the population of all Australian and Indian crocodiles.  (Note: formally, this is a test only of linear association with body length.)

\vspace{3cm}

#### Find and interpret a 95% confidence interval for $\beta_2$, the coefficient of `SpeciesIndian`.

```{r}
confint(parallel_lines_fit)
```

\vspace{3cm}

#### Find and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the mean head length of the sub-population of Australian crocodiles that have a total body length of 400cm.

```{r}
predict_data <- data.frame(
  Species = "Australian",
  Body = 400
)

predict(parallel_lines_fit, newdata = predict_data, interval = "confidence")
```
