**Office Hours:** Regularly scheduled office hours at times to be determined.  These are times I guarantee I will be in my office and available, but I am also available by appointment at other times.

**Extra Help:** We have a TA for this class, Sabirah Shuaybi.  She is fantastic.  She will hold regular office hours on **Thursday nights from 7-9pm in Clapp 420** as a time for group work, and is also available for individual one-on-one meetings.  I will share her calendar for booking appointments with you when we get it set up.

**Piazza:** We have a Piazza page at [https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2018/stat242](https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2018/stat242).  You can ask and answer questions there, anonymously if you want, and everyone in the class will be able to see and contribute to the answers.
