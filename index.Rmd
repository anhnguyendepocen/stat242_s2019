**Instructor:** Evan Ray

**Email:** eray@mtholyoke.edu

**Office:** Clapp 404C

**Office Hours:** Regularly scheduled office hours at times to be determined.  These are times I guarantee I will be in my office and available, but that should **not** be interpreted as indicating that these are the only times I'm willing to meet.

**Extra Help:** We have a TA for this class, Sabirah Shuaybi.  She is fantastic.  She will hold regular office hours on Thursday nights as a time for group work, and is also available for individual one-on-one meetings.

**Piazza:** We have a Piazza page at [https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2018/stat242](https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2018/stat242).  You can ask and answer questions there, anonymously if you want, and everyone in the class will be able to see and contribute to the answers.
